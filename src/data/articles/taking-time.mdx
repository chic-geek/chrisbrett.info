## Introduction

In August 2023, after a decade as a Frontend Developer, I chose to pause my career for a year. This decision wasn't made lightly; it was driven by a desire to reconnect with my family, reflect on my professional journey, and invest time in personal passions. This article shares insights into the complexities and outcomes of my sabbatical.

### Motivations for taking a sabbatical

The catalyst for my workforce pause was multifaceted, but the primary motivator was burnout. Years of navigating the highs and lows across startups, agencies, and large corporations, alongside significant personal life changes, resulted in an urgent need for respite and realignment. I'm sure many feel the same with Covid-19 stealing large chunks of our lives.

## Challenges encountered

### Financial Realities

The most immediate hurdle was financial. Transitioning from a stable income to relying on savings necessitated a new level of fiscal discipline and sacrifice, altering my lifestyle in fundamental ways. Saying no to things that were once routine was a sobering reminder of the trade-offs inherent in this decision.

### The discipline of unstructured time

Without the framework of a job, maintaining productivity proved challenging. Early months saw minimal coding; instead, I focused on family, travel, and rest. A critical period of decompression that genuinely reignited my professional enthusiasm.

### Reintegration anxiety

This sounded ridiculous in my head when I first wrote this but the prospect of returning to work is both thrilling yet daunting. The industry's increased competitiveness and the daunting task of proving my skills by way of NASA engineer level tests add layers of apprehension to my comeback.

## The unmistakable upsides

Despite the hurdles, the sabbatical has been overwhelmingly positive:

- Quality Time: Genuine quality time with my family and friends.
- Up-skilling: The break provided opportunities to learn and grow in new directions.
- Personal Projects: Dreams long deferred have become tangible projects.
- Career Reflection: I've gained a better understanding on my aspirations for the next decade.

Missing work was inevitable, but not the stress. Conversations with peers are irreplaceable, and the joy of creating impactful work continues to inspire me just as strongly. This pause has honed my understanding of my professional desires and personal boundaries, fostering a readiness to embrace or reject opportunities based on newfound self-awareness.

## Conclusion: The wisdom of a work hiatus

A career break is a monumental, not universally viable, decision. For those who can, it offers a unique chance to recalibrate and envision a future aligned with personal values and goals. As I stand at the foot of a tall mountain (my return), I'm not just anticipating the next chapter, I'm in a better position to shape it.
