## Introduction

In this tutorial, I'll show you how to setup a Next.js 13 Blog that utilises the new App Directory. It will use MDX (Extended Markdown) pages for the blogs themselves as well as TailwindCSS for the automatic styling of these blogs. We'll extend the functionality of the blog by looking at MDX Components that can add interactivity to our MDX blogs. Finally, we'll look at remark & rehype plugins, specifically remark-gfm which will allow "GitHub Flavoured" markdown such as tables and task lists.

- [next/mdx](https://www.google.com) - The official tool built by the Next.js team
- [mdx-bundler](https://www.google.com) - A fast, mdx compiler and bundler
- [next-mdx-remote](https://www.google.com) - Built by Hashicorp

## Setting up our app

To setup our application, we're going to use the following command. This will create the basic Next.js template application with TailwindCSS automatically configured.

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest --tailwind
```

When prompted we will select the following options:

- Project Name - choose an appropriate name such as my-mdx-blog
- Use Typescript - Yes
- Use ESLint - Yes
- Use src/ directory - No
- Use app/ directory - Yes
- Would you like to customize the default import alias - No

### Setup Packages

There are a few required packages to install; to do so, run the following commands:

- `npm install next-mdx-remote` - We will use this to display our MDX files as blogs
- `npm install gray-matter` - This will allow us to add metadata to our blogs such as title or description
- `npm install @tailwindcss/typography` - This will allow us to automatically style every markdown element in our blog without writing the CSS for every component ourself.

#### Add TailwindCSS Plugin

In the `tailwind.config.js` file, we now need to add the typography plugin to our current TailwindCSS setup:

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  ...
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/typography')
  ],
}
```
